PHP code writen by Rick Emmet

This code is available for anyone that wishes to view it. Please feel free to comment on the code in any way you see
fit. This is only a small part of a demonstration application that I have written. It is called Desert Rat and it can
be found at www.derertrat.net - you can see the application in action at the site. You can create an account and input records, or if you would prefer, you can use an existing account (which is listed on the index page).
